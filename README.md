# Data-Structures-in-Python
In-built Data Structures in Python

* Data Structures are used to store and manage data. We can create structures as per our or clients need.
* We can modify data and apply various functions or operations on it to derive the data as per our requirements.

## Types of Data Structures

* In-Built DS
    * Tuple
    * Sets
    * List
    * Dictionary
    
## [Tuple](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Data-Structures-in-Python/blob/master/Tuples.ipynb)
* Tuple are immutable, means they can't be changed. Once the value is stored inside a tuple it cant be modified, but we can use it to perform various actions on it.
* Tuple are similar to a List but just the difference it is immutable.
* Syntax to assign value inside a tuple --> tuple_name = (....)
* Tuple cosnist of a single data type.

## [List](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Data-Structures-in-Python/blob/master/List.ipynb)
* List is an ordered data structures.
* List are mutable, which means they can be updated or replaced or deleted.
* List can have any datatype included in it. It can mixtures of data types from string,int or tuple.
* List is defined as List_name=[..,...]
* Elements of the list can be iterated


## [Dictionary](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Data-Structures-in-Python/blob/master/Dictionary.ipynb)
* Dictionary are mutable data structure, which means they can be modified.
* Dicitonary consist of key-value pair.
* Dictionary is defined as **dict_name={key:value,key1:value1...}**
* Dictionary is unordered.


## [Sets](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Data-Structures-in-Python/blob/master/Sets.ipynb)

* Set are mutable unordered data structures.\n",
* They only consist of unique elements. no duplicates are present.\n",
* Sets are also defined using {} parenthesis like dictionary but there are no key value pairs only elements seprated by comma\n",
* **set_name={,,,}**"
